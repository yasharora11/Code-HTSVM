# Code-HTSVM
This repository provides the implementation of the HTSVM model proposed in the paper. It evaluates the classifier's performance on the Hepatitis dataset using 10-fold cross-validation. The Hepatitis dataset serves as a sample to demonstrate the usage of the code. The same code can be applied to the other datasets and also application datasets used in the paper by adjusting the parameters as described in the experimental setup.

## Files
- `HTSVM_algo.py`: Core model implementation (training and prediction)
- `Main.py`: Script to run 10-fold CV, compute metrics, and print summary
- `data/Hepatitis.xlsx`: Dataset used in the experiments

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
2. Import the data and
3. Run the code: Main.py
