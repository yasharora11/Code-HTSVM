# Code-HTSVM
This repository contains the implementation of the HTSVM model used in our paper. It evaluates the performance of the HTSVM classifier on the Hepatitis dataset using 10-fold cross-validation.

## Files
- `HTSVM_algo.py`: Core model implementation (training and prediction)
- `Main.py`: Script to run 10-fold CV, compute metrics, and print summary
- `data/Hepatitis.xlsx`: Dataset used in the experiments

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
2.  Run the code: Main.py
